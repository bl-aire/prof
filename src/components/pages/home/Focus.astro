                <h3>Transformative Teaching, Learning & Research</h3>
                <p>
                    As Deputy Vice Chancellor for Transformative Teaching,
                    Learning, and Research at USIU-Africa, I strengthen academic
                    quality, relevance, and innovation. My focus is on preparing
                    graduates to solve complex, real-world problems and ensuring
                    that higher education contributes directly to social and
                    economic development.

                <h3>Institutional Leadership & Governance</h3>
                <p>
                    I serve as Chair of Council at Nyandarua University College,
                    supporting strategic governance, institutional growth, and
                    community relevance. I also serve on the Board of Limuru
                    Girls School in Kenya, where I support values-based
                    education and leadership development for young women.

                <h3>Evidence, Policy & Learning Systems</h3>
                <p>
                    As Chair of the Network of Impact Evaluation Researchers in
                    Africa (NIERA), I work at the interface of research and
                    policy—strengthening evidence generation and use, convening
                    researchers and decision-makers, and promoting learning that
                    improves public programmes. This includes mentoring
                    academics and early-career researchers.
